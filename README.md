  # Whether to install mosquitto_pub and _sub cmds
  install_clients: false
  version: 1.4.*
  aws:
    enabled: yes
    region: eu-west-1
    # List of files that need to be copied and secured from S3
    # These should be things like TLS files
    s3_files:
     - bucket: config-bucket
       path: /mosquitto/tls/ca.crt
       dest: /etc/mosquitto/certs/ca.crt
       mode: "0600"
     - bucket: config-bucket
       path: /mosquitto/tls/server.crt
       dest: /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.crt
       mode: "0600"
     - bucket: config-bucket
       path: /mosquitto/tls/server.key
       dest: /etc/mosquitto/certs/server.key
       mode: "0600"
  # All key/value pairs under mosquitto.settings will be added to

    user_two: hash

```




## Examples

To simply install Mosquitto:

```YAML
- name: Install Mosquitto
  hosts: sandbox

  roles:
    - name: sansible.mosquitto
```

Overriding some settings:

```YAML
- name: Install Mosquitto with alternate port
  hosts: sandbox

  roles:
    - name: sansible.mosquitto
      mosquitto:
        settings:
          port: 8000
```

To set up with a password file:

```YAML
- name: Install Mosquitto with username/password file
  hosts: sandbox

  roles:
    - name: sansible.mosquitto
      mosquitto:
        settings:
          allow_anonymous: "false"
          password_file: /etc/mosquitto/passwd
        user_list:
          user_one: hash
          user_two: hash
```
This will create a password file with the username/password hash mosquitto.users_list.
Note that the mosquitto.settings.password_file variable must be set.

Passwords should be hashes generated by the mosquitto_passwd utility
